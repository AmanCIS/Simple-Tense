            Should You have a legitimate concern regarding a purchased Product, You will have a period of seven (7) days within which to request a free revision in accordance with the revision procedures set forth on the Website. This is a service that We provide to help ensure Your total satisfaction with Your completed Order. To receive this free revision, it is mandatory that You contact the Company within seven (7) days after You have received the Product created for Your Order. The Company will only give You a free revision should we find Your request valid. This policy will not extend past this seven (7) day time period. In addition, should Your concern regarding a purchased Product or Your request for a revision not be deemed legitimate under Your Order and the Company's policies regarding completion of Orders set forth in these Terms and Conditions, and within the Company's sole discretion, and should You nevertheless wish a revision to be made, the Company will advise You of the cost of the revision before commencing work. All Revisions will be returned to You within three (3) days of the Company accepting Your request, unless the number of pages or extent of revisions require otherwise, in which case the Company will advise You of the appropriate time period for delivery of the revisions to You. You may request further free revisions should You have a further legitimate concern regarding the final Product, but the validity of the request is again subject to the Company's sole discretion regarding the validity of Your concern. For Your information, based on Our experience, and the vast experience of Our writers, we normally consider any requests for more than three (3) successive free revisions to be excessive without extenuating circumstances. You can always request additional revisions according to the applicable rate, and the Company will provide a quote for revisions.
